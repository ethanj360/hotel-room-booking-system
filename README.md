**Hotel Conference Room Booking System (Systems Analysis Case Study)**

This project proposes the design of an internal conference room booking system for a mid-sized hotel. The goal is to replace manual and error-prone reservation processes with a structured, user-friendly system that improves operational efficiency, reduces booking errors, and increases revenue from conference room utilization.

The project follows the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and focuses on requirements gathering, feasibility analysis, system modeling, and solution design rather than software implementation.

## Overview

The system was designed as an internal reservation and management tool used by hotel booking specialists and managers. It supports creating, modifying, and canceling conference room reservations while securely managing customer data and tracking availability, payments, and room performance.

The design emphasizes accuracy, scalability, and usability while integrating with existing hotel operations.

## Key System Components

**Reservation Management**  
Handles the creation, modification, and cancellation of conference room reservations.

**Customer Accounts**  
Stores customer contact information and reservation history.

**Availability Tracking**  
Ensures accurate real-time tracking of conference room availability.

**Manager Oversight**  
Requires managerial acknowledgment for reservation changes or cancellations.

**Reporting and Data Storage**  
Supports long-term data storage for revenue tracking and performance analysis.

## Reflection

This project strengthened my ability to analyze business processes and translate operational needs into structured system designs. It reinforced the importance of clear requirements, stakeholder communication, and feasibility evaluation when proposing enterprise software solutions. The project also deepened my understanding of how systems design supports data-driven decision making and long-term scalability.
